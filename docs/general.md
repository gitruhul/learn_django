## MVC Architecture

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a design pattern used in software development to separate the components of an application into three interconnected elements:

1. **Model:** Represents the data and the business logic of the application. It manages data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

2. **View:** Represents the user interface (UI) and the presentation of data to the user. It is responsible for displaying information to the user.

3. **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It processes user inputs, triggers actions, and updates the Model and View accordingly.

MVC promotes the separation of concerns, making it easier to develop, maintain, and scale applications by isolating different aspects of the code. It is commonly used in web development, desktop applications, and other software projects to enhance organization and maintainability.
